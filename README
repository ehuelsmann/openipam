Project source
==============

This project is a fork from the project mentioned below. We wanted
to use it, but submitted patches have not been applied in the source.
We intend to merge commits from the original project to this one and
at the same time improve what's there.

To start, we're working to make the sources work on Debian Wheezy
both with and without SSL on the XML-RPC server and web frontend --
we found that without SSL it currently doesn't work.
