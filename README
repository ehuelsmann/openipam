Project source
==============

This project is a fork from the project mentioned below. We wanted
to use it, but submitted patches have not been applied in the source.
We intend to merge commits from the original project to this one and
at the same time improve what's there.

To start, we're working to make the sources work on Debian Wheezy
both with and without SSL on the XML-RPC server and web frontend --
we found that without SSL it currently doesn't work.


Feel free to create issues at
     https://github.com/ehuelsmann/openipam/issues


Dependencies
============

Debian Wheezy Packages
----------------------

Prefix the package lists with 'apt-get install' to make sure you have the
packages installed.

 * Shared by all
   postgresql

 * Backend (XML-RPC webservices)
   python-cherrypy3 python-ldap python-psycopg2
   python-openssl python-sqlalchemy python-ipy python-cjson

 * Front-end (web interface)
   python-cherrypy3 python-openssl python-cheetah python-ipy python-cjson

 * DHCP server (openDHCP)
   python-psycopg2 python-sqlalchemy

 * DNS server (PowerDNS)
   pdns-server pdns-backend-pgsql

 * SSL for backend and/or frontend
   ssl-cert

The website https://code.google.com/p/openipam/wiki/Installation also
lists python-processing for the DCHP server, but that dependency has
been eliminated due to the use of python 2.7.


Other distros
-------------


Please provide your package naming.


Installation
------------

Assuming you want to install all components, these are the steps to get
openIPAM set up on Debian Wheezy, after installing all the dependencies
listed above:

  adduser --home /usr/local/openipam --disabled-password \
          --gecos "openIPAM User" openipam

  ## THIS BLOCK ONLY IF YOU WANT SSL -- START
  apt-get install  ssl-cert
  adduser openipam ssl-cert
  ## THIS BLOCK ONLY IF YOU WANT SSL -- END

  mkdir -p /var/lib/openipam/sessions/backend
  mkdir -p /var/log/openipam/backend
  mkdir -p /var/lib/openipam/sessions/web
  mkdir -p /var/log/openipam/web
  chown -R openipam /var/lib/openipam /var/log/openipam

  su - openipam
  svn co https://github.com/ehuelsmann/openipam/trunk/openipam .
  cd openIPAM/
  svn export openipam_config.example openipam_config
  exit


  su - postgres
  createuser --pwprompt --no-superuser --no-createdb
             --no-createrole openipam
  # createuser asks for a password here. Remember it, we need it later!
  createdb -O openipam openipam
  exit


  su - openipam
  (psql -d openipam -f openIPAM/sql/openipam_schema.sql 2>&1) \
    | tee log | grep 'ERROR'
  # IF THE ABOVE SHOWS NO OUTPUT, CHECK THE 'log' FILE TO SEE IF THE COMMAND
  # RAN AT ALL. IF THE 'log' FILE IS NON-EMPTY AND THERE ARE NO ERRORS,
  # THE DATABASE SCHEMA LOADED CORRECTLY
  exit


  # The cherrypy patch https://code.google.com/p/openipam/wiki/Installation
  # speaks of, is outdated information: the patch is no longer required
