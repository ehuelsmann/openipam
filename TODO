Items to be addressed:

 * Unclear 'Type' field in 'Add domain' handling which -when filled-
   crashes the backend

 * More documentation everywhere

 * Installation script / installation checks "from the web"

 * Reorganize screens
   - put SOA, PTR and NS records in Domains screen
   - manage IP address pools from Networks screen
     (networks.py::network_form --> mentions "add DHCP groups"???)
   - create clear relationship between "Hosts" screen, Manage DNS and Domains

 * Remove the need for server side webservice handling:
   create a heavier browser client which calls the webservices
   directly
