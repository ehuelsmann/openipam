Instructions for upgrading openIPAM's jQuery library
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the UI, create a personalized download of the 
components here: http://ui.jquery.com/download_builder/

As of 10/20/08, these are the components selected for download:
- UI Core
- Draggable
- Resizeable
- Autocomplete
- Dialog (selecting this one autoselects Draggable and Resizeable)

The UI file is currently named: jquery-ui-personalized.min.js. 
(You should only have to remove the version number.)
(We are using the UI version 1.6rc2 as of 10/20/08.)

For the jQuery base, remove the version number from the file name 
and then you won't have to update anything anywhere else. 
If you do need to change the file name for the base file, 
go to framework.py to make the changes.
