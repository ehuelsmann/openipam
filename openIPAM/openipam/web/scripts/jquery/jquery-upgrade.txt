Instructions for upgrading openIPAM's jQuery library
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the UI, create a personalized download of the Dialog component (which should
also select the UI Core, Draggable, and Resizable components). At this point,
you will need to search all files for instances of the filenames and replace them.
This should be changed to be a config option.

For the jQuery base, copy the new file and update framework.py to reference the
new file.
